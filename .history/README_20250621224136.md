# 2D Random Walk 

## Introduction 

This code contains a simple 2D lattice random walk. An element starts at the center of window, and with uniform probability it can jump by a unit step to any of the four neighboring states. 

## Compile the Code 
To compile the code you will need [`SFML`](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/).

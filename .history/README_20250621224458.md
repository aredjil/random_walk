# 2D Random Walk 

## Introduction 

This code contains a simple 2D lattice random walk. An element starts at the center of window, and with uniform probability it can jump by a unit step to any of the four neighboring states. Once 

## Compile the Code 
To compile the code you will need [`SFML`](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/). Use the following command. 

```bash 
user@laptop:~$ g++ main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -o main.x 
```

Then simply run the code 
```bash
user@laptop:~$ ./main.x
```

A window will pop up with the simulation running.
